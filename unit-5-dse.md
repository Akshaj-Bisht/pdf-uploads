## Software Reliability

### Definition:
Software reliability refers to the probability of a software system functioning without failure for a specific period under given conditions. Unlike hardware, software does not degrade but may become obsolete as environments change.

### Key Points:
- Software does not wear out like hardware but may become unreliable due to external changes.
- Predicting software reliability is different from hardware reliability.
- Hardware redundancy can improve system reliability, but software lacks similar techniques.
- Earlier, software issues were attributed to hardware limitations, but even with improved hardware, software problems persist.

## Software Reliability Measurement

### Definition:
Software reliability measurement helps in assessing the stability and correctness of software over time.

### Key Points:
- Measurement methods include **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** and **Failure Rate**.
- Reliability can be evaluated using software testing, fault density analysis, and error-tracking.
- The goal is to reduce the number of defects and increase system dependability.

## Software Failure and Faults

### Definition:
A **software failure** occurs when the system does not perform as expected. **Faults** (or defects) are the underlying reasons for failures.

### Key Points:
