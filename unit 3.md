This chapter, "Software Project Planning," discusses the critical aspects involved in planning a software project.

**Importance of Planning and Estimation:**
After the finalization of Software Requirements Specification (SRS), it's crucial to estimate the size, cost, and development time of the project. Accurate estimation of cost and development time are vital for successful project completion. Many large software projects in the 1960s and 1970s failed due to poor planning, often resulting from inaccurate estimations. Software managers are responsible for planning and scheduling projects, ensuring development is on time and within budget.

**Key Elements of Software Project Planning:**
A successful software project plan must incorporate several major issues, including size and cost estimation, scheduling, project monitoring and reviews, personnel selection and evaluation, and risk management. To conduct successful software project planning, understanding the following is necessary: the scope of work to be done, the risk to be incurred, the resources required, the task to be accomplished, the cost to be expended, and the schedule to be followed. Software planning begins after technical work starts and continues as the software evolves. The primary activity in planning is estimating the size of the project, as this input is fundamental for estimating other activities like cost, development time, and schedule. Resource requirements are estimated based on cost and development time, and project scheduling depends on resource and development time.

**Software Size Estimation Techniques:**
The chapter covers several methods for estimating the size of a software project:

*   **Lines of Code (LOC):** This is one of the initial methods for size measurement. The number of lines of code in the final program is used as a metric. While seemingly simple, accurately counting LOC can be difficult as it's challenging to predict early in the project, and definitions of what constitutes a line of code can vary. The inclusion or exclusion of comments and blank lines can significantly affect the count. Despite its limitations, LOC can be useful for estimating programming time during the coding phase if historical data is available.
*   **Function Point Analysis (FPA):** Developed by Allan Albrecht while working for IBM, this method measures the functionality from the user's perspective. It considers inputs, outputs, enquiries, internal logical files, and external interface files. Each of these functional units is classified based on its complexity (Low, Average, or High). Weights are assigned to each complexity level for each functional unit. The Unadjusted Function Point (UFP) count is calculated by multiplying the count of each functional unit type by its corresponding weight based on complexity and summing these values. A Complexity Adjustment Factor (CAF) is then applied to the UFP to obtain the final Function Point (FP) count. The CAF is calculated based on 14 general system characteristics, each rated on a scale of 0 to 5 based on their degree of influence. Function points can be used to estimate productivity (FP/person-months), quality (Defects/FP), cost (Rupees/FP), and documentation (Pages of documentation per FP).
*   **Unadjusted Function Points (UFP) Calculation:** The formula for UFP is given as the sum over all five functional unit types (inputs, outputs, enquiries, internal logical files, external interface files) of the count of each type multiplied by its weight corresponding to its complexity.
*   **Final Function Point (FP) Calculation:** The formula for FP is FP = UFP * CAF, where CAF = 0.65 + 0.01 * Î£Fi, and Fi are the 14 complexity adjustment factors.

**Software Cost and Effort Estimation: The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO):**
COCOMO is a widely used, hierarchical cost estimation model. The basic model is suitable for small to medium-sized projects and considers three modes based on project characteristics and development environment: organic, semidetached, and embedded.

*   **Organic Mode:** For small, simple projects developed by small teams with good experience in a familiar environment.
*   **Semidetached Mode:** For medium-sized, intermediate projects where team members may have mixed experience.
*   **Embedded Mode:** For large, complex projects with tight constraints and requiring innovative designs.

The basic COCOMO model uses equations to estimate effort (E) in person-months and development time (D) in months, based on the estimated size in thousands of delivered source instructions (KLOC). The equations are of the form E = a<sub>b</sub>(KLOC)<sup>b<sub>b</sub></sup> and D = c<sub>b</sub>(E)<sup>d<sub>b</sub></sup>, where a<sub>b</sub>, b<sub>b</sub>, c<sub>b</sub>, and d<sub>b</sub> are coefficients that vary depending on the project mode. The average staff size (SS) and productivity (P) can also be calculated from the estimated effort and development time.

The intermediate COCOMO model introduces 15 cost drivers categorized into product attributes, computer attributes, personnel attributes, and project attributes to adjust the nominal effort estimate, thus increasing the accuracy.

**Software Risk Management:**
Risk management is crucial for identifying, addressing, and mitigating potential problems that could negatively impact the project's schedule, cost, or technical performance. The process involves understanding what constitutes a risk (a problem that could cause loss or threaten project success).

*   **Typical Software Risks:** The chapter lists several categories of typical software risks, including dependencies (reliance on external factors), requirement issues (uncertainty or instability in requirements), management issues (poor planning, unrealistic expectations), lack of knowledge (inadequate training or expertise), and other risk categories (e.g., unavailability of testing facilities).
*   **Risk Management Activities:** Risk management is an ongoing process with three key activities: risk assessment, risk control, and risk management planning.
    *   **Risk Assessment:** Involves identifying potential risks and analyzing their probability and impact. Risk identification can be facilitated by using checklists of common risk areas. Risk analysis examines the potential consequences of identified risks. Risk prioritization focuses on the most severe risks based on their likelihood and impact.
    *   **Risk Control:** Includes risk management planning (developing strategies to manage identified risks), risk monitoring (tracking the status of risks), and risk resolution (taking corrective actions when risks occur).

This chapter provides a foundational understanding of the essential activities involved in software project planning, emphasizing the importance of estimation and risk management for successful software development.
